Pulls latest POTA spots. Displays them in a compact interface. If you have an instance of `flrig` running, when you click on a spot your radio will automatically tune to the spotted frequency and change modes to match the spot.   Filter output to band and or mode. If you double click on a spot(s), spots from that activator will be highlighted green. You can use this keep track of who you have worked. Activators can be toggled off again by double clicking the activator a second time.

## Changes since 22.2.19 Instant Mashed

Added command line option to specify flrig server address:port.
To use a server not running on your local machine, launch it with either -s or --server, followed by the address and port separated by a colon.

Example: `potato -s 192.168.1.32:12345`

## Running from source

## Building a binary executable

I've included a .spec file in case you wished to create your own binary from the source. To use it, first install pyinstaller.

`python3 -m pip3 install pyinstaller`

Then build the binary.

`pyinstaller -F potato.spec`

Look in the newly created dist directory to find your binary.

Or execute the install.sh shell script in the install_icon folder to copy the binary from the dist directory to your ~/.local/bin folder and install a launcher icon.
